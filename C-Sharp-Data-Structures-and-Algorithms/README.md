# C# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is the code repository for [C# Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-data-structures-and-algorithms-0?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788833738), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Data structures allow organizing data efficiently. They are critical to various problems and their suitable implementation can provide a complete solution that acts like reusable code. In this book, you will learn how to use various data structures while developing in the C# language as well as how to implement some of the most common algorithms used with such data structures.

At the beginning, you will get to know arrays, lists, dictionaries, and sets together with real-world examples of your application. Then, you will learn how to create and use stacks and queues. In the following part of the book, the more complex data structures will be introduced, namely trees and graphs, together with some algorithms for searching the shortest path in a graph. We will also discuss how to organize the code in a manageable, consistent, and extendable way. By the end of the book,you will learn how to build components that are easy to understand, debug, and use in different applications.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
int[,] numbers = new int[,] = 
{ 
    { 9, 5, -9 }, 
    { -11, 4, 0 }, 
    { 6, 115, 3 }, 
    { -12, -9, 71 }, 
    { 1, -6, -1 } 
};
```

The book is aimed at programmers with various experience. However, beginners will also find some interesting content. Nevertheless, at least a basic knowledge of C#, such as about object-oriented programming, will be an added advantage.
